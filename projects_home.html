                     When businesses that use different currencies negotiate contracts with one another, they often have to agree upon a fixed, nominal 
                     price for the goods being traded. But, since exchange rates are somewhat volatile, this may result in one firm not being able to 
                     uphold their end of the deal further down the line, resulting in the need for a costly contract re-negotiation. The economic petri 
                     dish is an agent-based model that seeks to examine a potential solution to this problem: index-based pricing. Click on the tile to

                     Say you are in an auction. You know what kind of auction you're participating in (be it first price, second price etc), you know how 
                     many people you're bidding against, and you know what you value the the item at. You don't know what others' values are, only that 
                     they are probably uniformly distributed over some range. What should you bid? This project attempts to answer that question using some
                     economic/statistical theory and simulations. Click the tile to learn more.
