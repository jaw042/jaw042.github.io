               <h2>Project Overview</h2>
               The Economoic Petri Dish project was the brainchild of Canadian Economist and founder of Xalorithms, Joseph Potvin. He and Northwestern
               PhD student Jacob Kelter lead the project. The idea behind the project was to study the effects of index-based pricing, a mechanism 
               designed by Potvin, on contract negotiations between businesses using different currencies. In the context of a contract, index-based pricing
               involves agreeing on a price that is dependent on some index that reflects the value of some other, more stable item. The idea is that 
               by setting a price based on an index, the firms involved in contract negotiations can avoid the issues that may arise under volatile exchange
               rates. 
               <br>
               <br>
               In order to study index-based pricing, we built an agent-based model to simulate an economy in which firms negotiate contracts with one another 
               in order to trade. We built the model using Netlogo, an agent-based modeling software developed by the CCL Lab at Northwestern University. 
               Pictured to the left is the user interface for the model.

               <h2>Model Description</h2>
               The economic petri dish model contains the following agents:
               <ul>
                  <li>Households</li>
                  <li>Consumer good firms</li>
                  <li>Producer good firms</li>
                  <li>Framework agreements</li>
               </ul>
               Households are proxies for workers and consumers. A household is capable of providing labor in order to earn a wage, and capable of spending that
               wage on a consumer good. The user sets the total number of households in the model before each run.
               <br>
               <br>
               Consumer good and producer good firms are actually the same class class of agent in the model, albeit with slight differences. Firms employ households
               and pay them wages. They use the labor provided by households to produce goods. Consumer good firms sell their goods to households, and producer good
               firms sell to other firms, who then use that good as input for whatever they produce. Details such as what inputs firms require, how much of an input
               is needed to produce a good, and the overal number of each type of firm are set by the user in a json file. 
               <br>
               <br>
               Framework agreements are agreements between firms for the sale of a good. The agreements contain information such as the index being used, and the sale
               price relative to that index.
               <br>
               <br>
               The basic flow of the model is as follows:
               <ol>
                  <li>
                     At the beginning of a month (the standard time period in the model), firms receive the orders they placed from the previous month and hire/fire
                     labor based on their needs for the current month. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Next, firms place orders for the inputs they will need based on demand forecasts for the next month. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Consumer good firms sell their goods in the open market for the current month, and producer good firms produce goods to deliver in the next month.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     At the end of each month, firms calculate their revenues. Low performing firms go out of business and are replaced with new ones. Firms that have 
                     made losses for a certain number of periods renegotiate their framework agreements.
                  </li>
               </ol>
