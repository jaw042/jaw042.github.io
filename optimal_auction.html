               <h2>Project Overview</h2>
               The optimal auction strategy project was done for an economics class at Northwestern. The idea was to determine 
               how one should bid in an auction given the auction type, how many people are bidding, and a unique value for the 
               item being sold. We ran a series of pseudo-auctions in our class to collect data and used it to draw conclusions 
               about optimal strategies.
               <br>
               <br>
               <h2>Auction Types</h2>
               We tested several different types of auctions in our experiment:
               <ul>
                  <li>First price auctions - highest bidder wins and pays their bid; the winner has 
                     a utility equal to their value minus their bid, everyone else has utility 0
                  </li>
                  <li>Second price auctions - highest bidder wins and pays a price equal to the second highest bid; winner has
                     a utility equal to their value minus the second highest bid, everyone else has a utility of 0
                  </li>
                  <li>All pay auctions - highest bidder wins, but everyone pays their bid; the winner has a utility equal to 
                     their value minus their bid, everyone else has a utiilty equal to -bid
                  </li>
               </ul>
               The optimal strategy for a second price auction is to bid your value, and this can be proven trivially. Additionally 
               all pay auctions are somewhat rare, so for this overview, I'll focus on the first price auction piece of this
               experiment.

               <h2>Setup and Theoretical Optimal Strategies</h2>
               We operated our auctions under the following format:
               <ul>
                  <li>Participants would be assigned a random, uniformly distributed value between 1 and 100 (inclusive)</li>
                  <li>Participants would be told how many people they were bidding against, but not specifically who</li>
                  <li>Participants would enter their bids, as well as their values and number of opponents, using an online form</li>
               </ul>
               Under these assumptions, we can derive a theoretical optimal bidding strategy as a function of the number of participants
               in the auction and the value assigned to any given participant. The expected utility of a bid for a participant is simply 
               the probability that the participant wins with that bid multiplied by the utility they receive if they do win - see equations
               1 and 2. We can then differentiate the expected utility function with respect to bid and set the result equal to 0 to find
               the bid that maximizes expected utility - see equation 3. We assume equation 3 to be the optimal bidding strategy for a first
               price auction. You can use the desmos window at the top left of the page to visualize the expected utilities for different
               bid, value and auction size combinations (n is auction size, v is value, the x axis is bid and the y axis is expected utility).
               The viewport is locked by default, but you can unlock it by clicking on the wrench in the upper right hand corner and unchecking
               "lock viewport."

               <h2>Results</h2>
               The scatter plots on the left show the empirical expected utilities for different bids based on how participants actually bid. 
               The graphs are for an auction size of 2, and for values of 10, 57 and 80 in that order. If you adjust the desmos window to similar 
               settings, you'll find that the empirical graphs are pretty close to the theoretical predictions. In fact, we found that for an 
               auction of size 2, the empirical optimal strategy was to bid 0.48*value, with a standard error of 0.026. For an auction of size 
               16, we found that the optimal strategy was to bid 0.93*value, with a standard error of 0.01. Both of these estimates are very 
               close to the theoretical optimal bidding strategies, which is interesting because for the most part, people did not follow the
               optimal strategy. So, this suggests that regardless of other peoples' strategies, the theoretical optimal bidding strategyt is
               the way to go.
